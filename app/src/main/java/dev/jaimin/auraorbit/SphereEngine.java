/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * SphereEngine.java — The libGDX 3D Rendering Core
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * This is the heart of AuraOrbit — a libGDX ApplicationListener that renders
 * a true 3D sphere populated by app icon decals. It implements:
 *
 * ─── Rendering Pipeline ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **Background Layer** (SpriteBatch, 2D)
 *    Always rendered. Priority chain: custom photo (BackgroundStore /
 *    AppFetcher.loadBackgroundTexture) when one is set; else the current
 *    system (static) wallpaper mirrored via WallpaperManager.getDrawable()
 *    so the live wallpaper appears transparent; else a procedural vertical
 *    gradient texture as a final fallback.
 *
 * 2. **Group Backdrop Layer** (ModelBatch, 3D)
 *    Renders translucent colored convex-hull polygon patches behind each app
 *    group cluster. These patches are built as padded spherical polygons that
 *    precisely cover the group's icons, and they rotate rigidly with the sphere.
 *    IntAttribute.CullFace=GL_NONE makes patches visible from both the front
 *    and back of the sphere, so users can see where a group is even when it is
 *    on the far side.
 *
 * 3. **App Icon Layer** (DecalBatch, 3D billboarded)
 *    Renders app icons as 2D textured decals positioned in 3D space on
 *    the sphere surface. Each decal uses lookAt() billboarding to always
 *    face the camera. Icons on the far side of the sphere are scaled down
 *    and dimmed (depth-based scale/alpha) for a natural parallax effect.
 *
 * 4. **Empty-state hint** (SpriteBatch, 2D)
 *    When no apps are selected, a centered text hint is rendered on top of
 *    the background instructing the user to open AuraOrbit settings.
 *
 * ─── Physics ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - Rotation uses Quaternions exclusively (no Euler angles → no Gimbal Lock)
 * - User flings apply angular velocity with exponential friction (decays naturally)
 * - Idle spin uses a SEPARATE friction-free constant rotation (no pulse/stop cycle):
 *   idleBlend ramps from 0→1 over 1.5s after IDLE_DELAY seconds without interaction.
 *   Both idle rotation and decaying fling momentum can coexist in the same frame.
 * - All math is delta-time dependent for frame-rate independence
 * - Drag and physics rotations use pre-multiplication (mulLeft) so they always
 *   operate in world space regardless of accumulated sphere orientation.
 *
 * ─── Layout ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ALL N apps are placed on a single plain Fibonacci sphere for perfectly uniform
 * spacing. Every icon has the same inter-icon distance — grouped or not. Groups
 * stay spatially contiguous by ASSIGNING which Fibonacci lattice point each app
 * gets (a permutation), never by distorting the lattice.
 *
 * ─── Live Settings ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A SharedPreferences listener (strongly referenced in a field, because
 * SharedPreferences uses a WeakHashMap and would silently GC a lambda)
 * posts applyConfig() to the GL thread whenever a relevant key changes.
 * applyConfig() uses a snapshot string for deduplication — the same config
 * is never applied twice (prevents double-fire on resume + pref change).
 *
 * ─── Input ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - GestureDetector handles pan (one-finger rotation), fling (momentum),
 *   tap (preview-only launch), and pinch/two-finger-drag (priority rotation channel)
 * - Two-finger drag is the "priority channel": the launcher ignores two-finger
 *   drags on the wallpaper surface, so the sphere rotates without fighting the
 *   launcher's swipe-up / swipe-left one-finger gesture claims.
 * - 3D ray picking via Camera.getPickRay() + Intersector for app selection
 *
 * ─── Command-Gated Launching vs Direct-Tap Fallback ─────────────────────────
 *
 * AOSP-style launchers (Pixel Launcher, etc.) send an {@code android.wallpaper.tap}
 * command for every tap on empty workspace.  Apps launch ONLY via
 * {@link #onWallpaperTapCommand} on those launchers — the GestureDetector tap()
 * path is silenced on the home screen.  This is the safest path because the command
 * is emitted exclusively for taps on empty workspace; taps consumed by the app
 * drawer, icon grid, widgets, or search bar never produce it.
 *
 * Samsung One UI's launcher NEVER sends {@code android.wallpaper.tap} commands on
 * the home screen.  The field {@link #launcherSendsCommands} starts {@code false};
 * the first command received in {@link #onWallpaperTapCommand} from a REAL home
 * engine (not preview) flips it {@code true} permanently for the session.  When
 * the flag stays {@code false} (no command ever arrived from home), the GestureDetector
 * tap() path activates as a direct-tap fallback so that Samsung users can launch apps.
 *
 * On One UI, the launcher signals "leaving the plain home screen" (drawer/recents/
 * edit mode) by zooming the wallpaper out via {@code onZoomChanged} (API 30).  The
 * {@link #wallpaperZoom} field tracks this zoom level; the direct-tap path suppresses
 * launching when {@code wallpaperZoom > 0.4f} to guard against accidental launches
 * while the app drawer or recents overlay is open.
 *
 * ─── One UI Preview Bug: tap commands on every finger-up ─────────────────────
 *
 * Samsung One UI's wallpaper-PREVIEW screen DOES send {@code android.wallpaper.tap}
 * commands — and fires them on every finger-up, including releases of rotation drags.
 * This caused two separate bugs:
 *
 * 1. "Moving sphere in preview opens app when I release my finger" — the command
 *    fired at the end of every drag in preview mode.
 * 2. "Clicking not working on home, but works in preview" — if {@link #onWallpaperTapCommand}
 *    were allowed to set {@link #launcherSendsCommands} during preview, the SHARED
 *    engine would believe the launcher supports commands and suppress direct taps on
 *    the home screen, where One UI home NEVER sends them.
 *
 * Fix: {@link #onWallpaperTapCommand} ignores commands entirely when
 * {@link #isPreviewMode} is {@code true}.  Preview launching works through the
 * GestureDetector tap() path, which correctly distinguishes taps from drag releases.
 * Only home-screen commands (non-preview) are valid proof that the launcher supports
 * the command protocol.
 *
 * In the wallpaper-picker preview there is no launcher, so no commands arrive and
 * {@link #launcherSendsCommands} stays {@code false}.  The GestureDetector path
 * therefore also fires in preview mode ({@link #isPreviewMode}), which is exactly
 * the right behavior for testing tap-to-launch without going to the home screen.

     * Uncapped regime: spacing = 1.843 × iconSize, so packFraction × spacing ≥
     * 1.013 × iconSize ≥ iconSize for the entire [0.55..0.95] range — min() always
     * returns iconSize, preserving identity (the slider is also live here via iconSize).
     *
     * Capped regime (screen-width cap binds, e.g. Galaxy S25 Ultra with ~60 apps):
     * spacing is fixed (effectiveRadius cannot grow), so packFraction directly controls
     * effectiveIconSize across a broad, visible range.  Previously the bound was the
     * CONSTANT 1/(0.52 × √N) × effectiveRadius ≈ 0.543 × spacing, making the slider's
     * upper range completely dead.  The pack-fraction approach keeps the slider live.

     * 0.95 spacing is the upper bound so icons never overlap (5% clearance to neighbor).

    /**
     * Distributes all N app nodes uniformly on the sphere using a single plain
     * Fibonacci sphere lattice, then assigns positions to nodes so that group
     * members occupy a contiguous patch of the lattice.
     *
     * ─── Why Plain Fibonacci (not slot+sunflower)? ────────────────────────
     *
     * The old slot+sunflower layout squeezed group members into spherical caps
     * whose radius was bounded by the slot-separation angle — causing members
     * to collide with neighboring slots' icons when groups were large. More
     * fundamentally, the sunflower sub-layout used different inter-icon spacing
     * inside a group than the global Fibonacci spacing, so apps had unequal
     * distances to their neighbors depending on whether they were grouped.
     *
     * The new approach: ALL N icons live on the SAME Fibonacci lattice, so
     * every icon has the same minimum angular separation to its nearest neighbor,
     * grouped or not.
     *
     * ─── Contiguous Group Assignment ─────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * We permute which lattice point each app gets (never moving the points):
     *
     *   1. Compute N Fibonacci unit directions as candidate positions.
     *   2. Sort groups in descending member-count order so large groups get
     *      first pick of the best-separated seed points.
     *   3. For each group: pick a seed = the unassigned lattice point with the
     *      maximum min-angular-distance to ALL already-assigned points (i.e.,
     *      the point that is farthest from everything assigned so far). For
     *      the very first group (nothing assigned yet) any point works — use
     *      index 0. Then greedily assign the (M−1) nearest unassigned points
     *      to the seed direction (by dot-product to seed). This yields a
     *      spatially contiguous patch of pristine lattice points.
     *   4. Ungrouped apps fill remaining lattice points in original index order.
     *   5. nodePositions[i] holds the position for appNodes.get(i)
     *      — the appNodes list order is never changed.
     *
     * O(N²·G) brute-force complexity is fine for N ≤ a few hundred.
     *
     * ─── Adaptive Radius ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     *   effectiveRadius = clamp(0.52 × iconSize × √N, 1.6×iconSize, sphereRadius)
     *
     * 0.52 gives more breathing room than the old 0.48 so icons are comfortably
     * spaced. The group-spread floor term is gone — no caps or sub-layouts any more.
     * computeCameraDistance() still uses sphereRadius (the slider) as its
     * reference, so the camera envelope is fixed.

    /**
     * Builds translucent colored convex-hull polygon patches behind each app group.
     *
     * ─── Visual Design ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * Each group gets a semi-transparent polygon positioned at radius
     * 0.90 × effectiveRadius — slightly inside the icon sphere so patches appear
     * as colored cloth draped under the group's icons. The polygon fully encloses
     * every member icon with a smooth rounded margin via Minkowski-sum padding.
     *
     * IntAttribute.CullFace=GL_NONE disables back-face culling so patches are
     * visible from both sides of the sphere. Opacity is modulated per-frame:
     * vivid (alpha 0.35) when the patch faces the camera (front), faint (alpha 0.12)
     * when on the far side — giving the user a clear depth cue to rotate toward it.
     *
     * ─── Why Gnomonic Projection? ─────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * The convex hull of the group's icons must be computed in a flat 2D space.
     * Gnomonic projection maps geodesics (great-circle arcs on the sphere) to
     * straight lines in the plane, so the 2D convex hull of the projected
     * points IS the spherical convex hull of the original directions. For the
     * small angular extents of typical groups (≪ hemisphere), gnomonic
     * coordinates are nearly identical to simple tangent-plane projection,
     * and d·c > 0 always holds.
     *
     * ─── Algorithm ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     *   1. Centroid direction c = normalized sum of member unit directions.
     *   2. Build tangent basis (t1, t2) at c.
     *   3. Gnomonic project each member d → (u, v): s = 1/(d·c), u=s(d·t1), v=s(d·t2).
     *   4. Minkowski-sum padding: for every member point (u,v) generate K=12 circle
     *      samples of radius pad = 0.8×iconSize/effectiveRadius around it. Run
     *      Andrew's monotone-chain hull over ALL M×K samples. This yields the convex
     *      hull of the union of discs — every member icon sits fully inside the
     *      colored area with a rounded margin. M==2 naturally yields a stadium shape.
     *   5. Subdivide each hull edge so no segment spans > 0.15 gnomonic units.
     *   6. Inverse-project boundary vertices back to sphere at 0.90R.
     *   7. Fan-triangulate from centroid vertex; add mid-ring for sphere-curvature.
     *   8. Material: group color at 32% alpha (base; overridden per-frame for depth cue),
     *      GL_NONE cull face.
     *
     * ─── Geometry in sphere-local space ──────────────────────────────────
     *
     * All positions are in sphere-local coordinates (actual 3D positions), so
     * the per-frame transform is simply sphereRotation + pageVisibility scale
     * (identity base — no per-cap orientation matrix needed).

     * Configures input handling with a subclassed GestureDetector for:
     * - **Pan** (one-finger): Converts 2D screen drag into 3D sphere rotation
     * - **Fling**: Applies angular momentum for inertial spinning
     * - **Tap**: Raycasts to detect which app was tapped and launches it
     * - **Pinch / two-finger drag**: Priority rotation channel — uses the
     *   midpoint delta of two pointers to rotate the sphere.  The launcher
     *   ignores two-finger drags on the wallpaper, so this gesture is never
     *   contested.  One-finger pan() is suppressed while pinchActive is true
     *   to prevent double-application.

     * ─── Why subclass GestureDetector? ──────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * GestureDetector.touchCancelled() (verified in libGDX 1.13.0 bytecode)
     * calls only cancel() internally, which clears longPressFired but does NOT
     * clear the internal `pinching` flag.  Separately, reset() clears panning
     * and inTapRectangle but also does NOT clear `pinching`.  Two paths that
     * bypass pinchStop() are therefore:
     *   • touchCancelled (fires on notification-shade pull, system gesture, etc.)
     *   • reset()
     * Without interception our pinchActive would stay true forever after any
     * of these paths, permanently killing one-finger pan.  The subclass below
     * intercepts both touchCancelled and touchDown so the outer pinchActive
     * flag is always consistent with the actual touch state.

    /**
     * Attempts to commit a horizontal page swipe to the dead-reckoning
     * {@link #inferredPage} counter.  Called at the end of each pan/fling
     * gesture (in {@code panStop} and {@code fling}) when the gesture has
     * NOT already been counted ({@link #gestureCounted} guard prevents
     * double-counting when both callbacks fire for the same gesture).
     *
     * <p>Conditions required to count a page change (all must be true for ALL paths):
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Not in preview mode — inference never runs in preview; the sphere
     *       is always fully visible there and previewStateChange forces
     *       pageVisibility = 1.</li>
     *   <li>Not a two-finger pinch — pinchActive gates out this path so only
     *       one-finger horizontal swipes are counted as page changes.</li>
     *   <li>Wallpaper not zoomed ({@code wallpaperZoom < 0.2f}) — One UI zooms
     *       the wallpaper during drawer/recents/edit mode; swipes in those
     *       contexts should not advance the page counter.</li>
     *   <li>Offsets are not live (see {@link #offsetEverSeen} /
     *       {@link #lastOffsetTimeNanos}) — the offset path handles visibility
     *       when the launcher continuously reports page positions.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>A page change is counted when EITHER of these conditions is satisfied:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Slow committed drag (path A)</b>: |totalDx| &gt; 0.30 × viewportW
     *       AND |totalDx| &gt; 1.5 × |totalDy|.  The 30 % threshold (lowered from
     *       35 %) better matches launchers that commit pages at a smaller travel.</li>
     *   <li><b>Velocity flick (path B)</b>: gesture ended in {@code fling()} with
     *       |velocityX| &gt; 1 200 px/s AND |velocityX| &gt; 1.5 × |velocityY| AND
     *       |totalDx| &gt; 0.04 × viewportW.  The tiny travel floor (4 %) rejects
     *       micro-jitter events that are not real lateral swipes.  This path
     *       matches Samsung One UI's fling-commit semantics where a short fast
     *       flick changes pages even when the finger traveled less than 30 % of
     *       screen width.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Note on rotation drags: a horizontal rotation drag on the sphere is the
     * same physical gesture as a page swipe on One UI — the launcher scrolls its
     * pages regardless of whether the wallpaper consumed the touch.  Counting such
     * drags here is therefore correct: if the launcher committed a page change,
     * our dead-reckoning counter should too.
     *
     * <p>Direction: totalDx (or velocityX for path B) &lt; 0 → next page
     * (inferredPage++); &gt; 0 → previous page (inferredPage--).
     * Clamped to [0, 8]; reaching 0 or 8 re-syncs the counter at the
     * launcher's boundary even if prior drift accumulated.
     *
     * <p>Called on the GL thread (GestureDetector callbacks run on GL thread).
     * All fields accessed here are GL-thread-owned — no synchronization needed.
     *
     * @param velocityX  Fling velocity in px/s along X (positive = right); 0 when called
     *                   from panStop (no fling velocity available).
     * @param velocityY  Fling velocity in px/s along Y; 0 when called from panStop.

     * 2. IDLE SPIN (idleBlend):
     *    Completely friction-free constant Y-axis rotation that engages after
     *    IDLE_DELAY seconds of no user interaction. idleBlend ramps from 0→1
     *    over 1.5 seconds (smooth ramp-in, no visible jump) and is reset to 0
     *    immediately when the user touches the screen.
     *    Applied via a direct per-frame angle = IDLE_SPIN_SPEED * rotationSpeedFactor
     *    * idleBlend * delta (radians).
     *
     * Both contributions are applied the same frame — fling decays away naturally
     * while idle ramps in, so the transitions are smooth and continuous.
     *
     * ─── Why not implement idle via angularVelocity + impulse? ────────────
     *
     * Setting angularVelocity.y = IDLE_SPIN_SPEED in the impulse-rearming
     * pattern triggers an immediate impulse that the per-frame friction then
     * decays within ~0.7 s, causing a visible pulse/stop/pulse cycle. Separating
     * idle spin from fling physics entirely eliminates that artifact.
     *
     * ─── Why mulLeft (pre-multiply)? ──────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * The angular velocity vector and idle axis are defined in world space.
     * Pre-multiplying ensures the rotation always acts on world axes, consistent
     * with the pan handler. Post-multiplying would rotate in the sphere's local
     * space, causing the auto-spin axis to drift as orientation accumulates.
     *

     * sphere; swiping back shows it.  On offset-reporting launchers (Pixel Launcher
     * etc.) offsets are live and the inferred counter is not used.
     *
     * When offsets are live but the current step happens to be zero (transient state
     * during launcher animations), we stay fully visible rather than snapping to an
     * inferred page — this is the least disruptive behaviour for the brief moment the
